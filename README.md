# Slack Clone

A Slack clone built using Express, GraphQL and React.

Based on the tutorial from https://awesomereact.com/playlists/slack-clone-using-graphql/0MKJ7JbVnFc.

## Running locally
 - Requires PostgreSQL.  If on a Mac use Homebrew to install.  If not follow these instructions https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/pginstaller-install-postgresql/.
 - Clone the repo at https://github.com/craigstroman/slack-clone.git.
 - CD into slack-clone.
 - Run `npm install` to install all required Node moduels.
 - Run `npm run live:server` to start server environment.
 - Open a new terminal window and run `npm run live:client`.

 Note: This is a work in progress.  I'm continuing to update this and add features.
